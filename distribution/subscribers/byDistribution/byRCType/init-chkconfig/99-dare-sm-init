# LSB RC (Return Codes) for all commands but status:
# 0	 - success
# 1  - generic or unspecified error
# 2  - invalid or excess argument(s)
# 3  - unimplemented feature (e.g. "reload")
# 4  - user had insufficient privileges
# 5  - program is not installed
# 6  - program is not configured
# 7  - program is not running
# 8--199  - reserved (8--99 LSB, 100--149 distrib, 150--199 appl)
#
# Note that starting an already running service, stopping
# or restarting a not-running service as well as the restart
# with force-reload (in case signaling is not supported) are
# considered a success.
#
# LSB RC for status command:
# 0 - service up and running
# 1 - service dead, but /var/run/  pid  file exists
# 2 - service dead, but /var/lock/ lock file exists
# 3 - service not running (unused)
# 4 - service status unknown :-(
# 5--199 reserved (5--99 LSB, 100--149 distro, 150--199 appl.)
